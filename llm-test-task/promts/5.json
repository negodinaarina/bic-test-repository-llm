    "text": "\nHmm, user wants a very short poem about the sun. That's simple but fun! They probably need something punchy for a greeting card, social media post, or maybe a classroom activity. \n\nOkay \"very short\" suggests under 5 lines. Should avoid clichÃ©s like \"sunshine makes me happy\" - too generic. Focus on one vivid image... \n\nWhat's the sun's most essential quality? Warmth. Light. Life-giving. Maybe end with a twist? Like how it \"sips\" the sea? Personification makes it fresh. \n\nRhythm-wise: couplet feels complete. AABB rhyme scheme keeps it musical. \"Gold\" and \"old\" rhyme perfectly - and that final image ties back to the sun's eternal nature. \n\nUser didn't specify audience. Keeping it accessible but with subtle depth: \"sips the sea\" implies oceans evaporating, while \"old\" nods to the sun's ancient age. Hope they appreciate that layer! \n\n...Cutting it at 4 lines. Any shorter would be fragmentary. This fits \"very short\" while standing as proper poetry. Fingers crossed it shines for them! ðŸ”¥The sun is gold,\nSo old and bold,\nSips the seaâ€”\nFire-free. ðŸŒž",
